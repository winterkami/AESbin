#### Backend & Database: User Authentication System (Login and Registration)
- **PHP backend** to handle user registration and login, storing user credentials (email and hashed passwords) securely in a MySQL database.
- **Registration form (`register.php`)** validates input fields, hashes passwords with a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt), and stores user details.
- **Login form (`login.php`)** validates user credentials by comparing the hashed password from the database with the provided input.
- A **PHP session** is initiated upon successful login, storing the user's session data (e.g., `user_id`).
- Secure handling of session state ensures unauthorized users cannot access restricted pages like the `Dashboard` page.
- Includes **`check_session.php` endpoint** to validate the login status of users across different pages.

---

#### Backend, Frontend & Database: User-Specific Dashboard Content Viewing
- **PHP backend (`dashboard.html`)** retrieves user-specific data from the database using the `user_id` stored in the session, ensuring that only logged-in users can view their past entries.
- Dynamic fetching of user-specific submissions, sorted by submission date, and limited by pagination for efficient display.
- The **frontend verifies the user's login status** via a `checkLoginStatus` function in `common.js`, redirecting unauthorized users to the login page.
- The table content dynamically displays the entries with fields such as date submitted, content preview, unique ID, and visit count.
